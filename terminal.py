            # Wow, that took too much time, I think I'm going to faint after realizing that I need to do more work just to make this better.
            # IdioticCoding, made by aluta.
            # I'm planning to add more stuff to this, I think I'm going to add a survey, some minigames and something that leads to websites, like a website generator planning to have it generate 10 websites to read or use, 
            # -and maybe even add a youtube command like startyt. The generators label will be called "websitegenidt".
            # but for now, my ideas are youtube command, generation command, and surveys and minigames, I will work on a minesweeper version for this in the future, It's projected to take about 3 weeks of coding, but stay tuned
            # I'll keep on working.
            # I'll work on this list, deleting one by one after finish my plans, small projects will be made later added to this project. aluta out.
